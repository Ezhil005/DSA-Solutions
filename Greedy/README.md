## 📂 Problem List

- [WaveArrayLexSmallest.java](WaveArrayLexSmallest.java): Converts an array into a wave-like pattern (a1 ≥ a2 ≤ a3 ≥ a4...) while ensuring the lexicographically smallest result. Sorts the array and swaps adjacent pairs.
- [TensDigitSorting.java](TensDigitSorting.java): Sorts integers by tens digit (ascending). If equal, sorts by value (descending). Uses custom comparator.
