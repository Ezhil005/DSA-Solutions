## 📘 What’s Inside

Interval problems often involve merging overlapping ranges, detecting gaps, and optimizing time-based events. These solutions cover foundational techniques like:

- Interval merging
- Range scanning
- Edge case handling
- Efficient use of ArrayLists

## 📂 Problem List
- [MergeOverlappingIntervals.java](MergeOverlappingIntervals.java): Merges overlapping intervals into consolidated ranges using a linear scan. Assumes input is sorted by start time.
- [InsertAndMergeInterval.java](InsertAndMergeInterval.java): Inserts a new interval into a sorted list and merges overlapping intervals using sorting and linear scan
