## ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside

Matrix problems often involve navigating rows, columns, diagonals, and subgrids. These solutions cover foundational techniques like:

- Diagonal traversal
- Submatrix operations
- Row/column manipulation
- Pattern-based printing

## ðŸ“‚ Problem List
- [PrintMainDiagonal.java](PrintMainDiagonal.java): Print the main diagonal elements of a 2D matrix where row index equals column index
- [PrintAntiDiagonal.java](PrintAntiDiagonal.java): Print the anti-diagonal elements of a 2D matrix where row + column equals n - 1
- [PrintAllDiagonalsTopRightToBottomLeft.java](PrintAllDiagonalsTopRightToBottomLeft.java): Print all diagonals starting from top row and rightmost column moving down-left
- [TransposeInPlace.java](TransposeInPlace.java): Transpose a square matrix in-place by swapping mat[r][c] with mat[c][r]
- [Rotate90Clockwise.java](Rotate90Clockwise.java): Rotate a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place using transpose and row reversal
- [AntiDiagonals.java](AntiDiagonals.java): Generate all anti-diagonals of a square matrix and pad each row with zeros to maintain uniform width
- [WeightedSumDescending.java](WeightedSumDescending.java): Sort an array in descending order and compute the weighted sum using 1-based indexing
- [CountNobleIntegers.java](CountNobleIntegers.java): Count all noble integers in an array including duplicates, where x equals the number of elements greater than x
