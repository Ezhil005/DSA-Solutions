# 🔍 Searching Algorithms

This folder contains classic searching techniques implemented in Java. Each algorithm is optimized for different scenarios — from brute-force linear scans to efficient logarithmic-time binary searches. All solutions are written for clarity, edge-case handling, and recruiter visibility.

## 📁 File Structure
- [FirstOccurrenceBinarySearch.java](SearchingAlgorithms/FirstOccurrenceBinarySearch.java): Finds the first index of a target value in a sorted array using binary search. Handles duplicates.
- [BinarySearch.java](SearchAlgorithms/BinarySearch.java): Implements binary search on a sorted array. Returns true if target is found, false otherwise.
