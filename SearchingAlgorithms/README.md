# üîç Searching Algorithms

This folder contains classic searching techniques implemented in Java. Each algorithm is optimized for different scenarios ‚Äî from brute-force linear scans to efficient logarithmic-time binary searches. All solutions are written for clarity, edge-case handling, and recruiter visibility.

- [PeakElementBinarySearch.java](https://github.com/Ezhil005/DSA-Solutions/blob/master/SearchingAlgorithms/PeakElementBinarySearch.java): Finds a peak element in an array using binary search. A peak is defined as an element greater than its neighbors. Handles edge cases and returns the peak value. Time complexity: O(log n).
- [SearchInRotatedSortedArray.java](https://github.com/Ezhil005/DSA-Solutions/blob/main/SearchingAlgorithms/RotatedSortedSearch/SearchInRotatedSortedArray.java): Searches for a target value in a rotated sorted array using binary search. Efficiently identifies the sorted half and narrows the search space. Returns the index of the target or -1 if not found. Time complexity: O(log n).
