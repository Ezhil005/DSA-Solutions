# 🔍 Searching Algorithms

This folder contains classic searching techniques implemented in Java. Each algorithm is optimized for different scenarios — from brute-force linear scans to efficient logarithmic-time binary searches. All solutions are written for clarity, edge-case handling, and recruiter visibility.
