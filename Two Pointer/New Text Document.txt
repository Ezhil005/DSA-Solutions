# ðŸ§­ Two Pointers â€” Efficient Array Techniques

This folder contains Java solutions to problems solved using the **Two Pointers** technique â€” a powerful pattern for optimizing array and string traversal. These problems are commonly asked in coding interviews and help reduce brute-force time complexity to linear or near-linear time.

---

## ðŸ“˜ What is Two Pointers?

The Two Pointers approach involves using two indices (usually `start` and `end`) to scan through data in a coordinated way. Itâ€™s ideal for:

- Sliding window problems
- Partitioning arrays
- Finding pairs or triplets
- Optimizing brute-force nested loops

## ðŸ“‚ Problem List
- [MaxSumFromEnds.java](MaxSumFromEnds.java): Maximize the sum of B elements removed from either end of the array using a two-pointer sliding window
